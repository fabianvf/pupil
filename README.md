# Pupil
Open source eye tracking hardware and software platform that started as a thesis project at MIT. Pupil is a project in active, community driven development. The hardware is accessible, hackable, and affordable. The software is open source and written in Python and C when speed is an issue.

Our vision is to create tools for a diverse group of people interested in learning about eye tracking and conducting their eye tracking projects.
